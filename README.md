# Vampire Vanquisher

This is a simple SUD (single user dungeon) game I created for my programming methods course.

You can play as four distinctive classes with different stats, skills, and progression.
Enemy mobs scale with player stats to create more meaningful and challenging encounters.
There are two unique enemy mobs to create a level of unpredictability so the player will have to be weary when exploring.
Finally, the end-game boss is quite strong, so players should adequately prepare for the final battle.

Hope you enjoy!
